In this exercise, your goal is to test-drive an object model that calculates the total distance 
(in miles) and duration (in days and hours) of a trip from a city on one coast to a city on the other, 
traversing a specific set of cities along the way. 

The catch is that you must implement a doubly-linked ring to represent the trip, and you must not use and Java 
(or Google or other) collections.
