In this exercise, your goal is to test-drive an object model that calculates the total distance 
(in miles) and duration (in days and hours) of a trip from a city on one coast to a city on the other, 
traversing a specific set of cities along the way, for a family in a minivan. 

The catch is that you must implement a doubly-linked ring to represent the trip as Nodes, where each Node is either a Leg 
or a Stop, and you must not use any Java (or Google or other) collections. 

Some other contraints apply.

This doubly-linked ring (a Trip class) must support the following API:

-- addLeg(Node node);
-- addStop(Node node);
-- removeLeg(Place start, Place end);

Further, a Leg, as a type of Node, must support this API: 

-- setAverageSpeed();  


A Stop can be either a HotelStay or CampgroundStay. The minimum duration for a HotelStay is 12 hours. 
The minimum duration for a CampgroundStay is 14 hours. 

Our poor family is budget-constrained: they cannot afford more than 3 HotelStays. Every other Stop must be a CampgroundStay. 

I'll make up more evil constraints as I think of them. That's all for now. :)
